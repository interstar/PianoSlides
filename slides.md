## Music Theory is Weird!

This is "C-major", the foundation of Western music.

#### C Major Scale

C - D - E - F - G ...

Can you guess what comes next? 

----
### Erm ...

After "G" comes "A"

C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C

The most basic, beginner scale starts with "C", and ends in "B".

Or rather ... there's another "C" above it.

**Obvious, right?**

### The Major Scale

Intervals are the distance between two notes.

C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C
